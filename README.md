# Controversy

Russia will takedown suicide discussions like this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevebest/suicide/master/suicide.md with notices similar to a DMCA https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/blob/master/Russia/2017/2017-02-08-roskomnadzor.md This has the strange effect of censoring all of github if they want to block a specific page, because being https, you can't censor a specific page

The removal of these rings also takes down groups centered on self harm and anorexia on social media, which can be good or bad depending on how you view the way these groups work.

# Support

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a free, confidential 24-7 service that can provide people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress, or those around them, with support, information and local resources. 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
